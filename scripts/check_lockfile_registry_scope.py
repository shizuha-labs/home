"""Validate package-lock.json `resolved` hosts against the scope->registry contract.

CoS ruling 2026-07-22 (PLAT-5031; Verdaccio runbook v22 e098c698), BOTH directions:

    public package      -> registry.npmjs.org                          (public only)
    @shizuha/* package  -> npm-cache.registry.svc.cluster.local:4873   (internal only)

Rationale for each direction, from real incidents:

  public-on-internal  (mode 1) A pin to the in-cluster cache -- or worse a node-IP
                      NodePort -- is unreachable off-cluster, so `npm ci` cannot run
                      on a runner without cluster access. `--registry` cannot override
                      it: npm honours `resolved` verbatim. PLAT-5031 found 1018 such
                      pins across 6 repos. I then reintroduced one myself in hive#50's
                      first commit by repointing public packages to the cache, and my
                      own host-only checker passed it -- which is why this direction
                      is enforced rather than assumed.

  private-on-public   (mode 2) `@shizuha/*` is a private scope; it 404s on the public
                      registry at ANY version. A lockfile can therefore be entirely
                      host-clean and still uninstallable. HIVE-1270 cost hive-frontend
                      three days of blocked deploys this way; drive/id/connect carried
                      the same defect latently.

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 violations found, 2 nothing scanned (fail closed).
